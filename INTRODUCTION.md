# GetFunkin-Modding
Yeah It's time to start modding! How do you start using FNFM+? What's FNFM+? You'll find out soon enough
You have a choice to make at the start of this modding adventure! You can attempt compiling but you'll need a decent amount of storage and patience (coding knowledge too ofc)
but If you don't wanna do that you can download this and get started ASAP
https://github.com/FunkinModdingPlus/ModdingPlus/actions or https://dev.azure.com/benharless820/FNF%20Modding%20Plus/_build or https://harlessben321.itch.io/
Once you finish downloading that I reccomend asking for help https://discord.gg/Sy9CZS3D5Q and reading the "README" here
